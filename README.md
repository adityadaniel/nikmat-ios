This app is built as learning purpose exploring various new API Apple introduced in WWDC 2021, including Swift concurrency features and trying few new SwiftUI modifier such as refreshable and searchable.

Due to the nature of API used in this application, I believe I couldn't bring this app to the App Store, so if you find this app useful, you can download Xcode from Mac App Store and compile it on your device. 

Hope you find it useful. Any feedback, PR are greatly appreciated
